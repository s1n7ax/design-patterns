# design-patterns
Implementations of examples from Head First Design Patterns book.

I'm not the book reading type of guy but let me tell you, I highly recommend reading the book. It's not boring at all.

Right now, you probably are in the `main` branch of the repository. You can switch the branch to the design pattern you want to lean. 
Each branch represents a different design pattern. I will number the branches in the same order they are in the book.

## What do we have here
* In `README` you will find the problem and how particular designer pattern solves the problem in words
* Each design pattern includes a Java project that has `problem` and `solution` packages



## How to import the project
* I'm using gradle just because I hate `xml` in maven
* One thing you need to do before importing the project into eclipse
	* run `./gradlew cleanEclipse eclipse`
* Import the project to eclipse
* You know the rest right?


*Let's start*
